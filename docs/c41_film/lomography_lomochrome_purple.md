# Lomography Lomochrome Purple

Lomochrome purple is great. It is fun. It is C-41 film available in 110, 35mm, and 120. It has a bunch of color shifts:

* Greens become purples
* Blues become cyan
* Yellows become pinks
* Oranges become magenta
* Red generally stays the same

Lomography claims you can rate it anywhere from ISO 100 to 400. As with most color negative films, high ISO leads to more saturuation and contrast at the expense of losing shadow detail and more grain. Shooting it at 200 has always been the best option.

The original manufacturer of Lomochrome Purpole is unknown.

## What is the color swap?

* Color film is made of several layers, including a red-, green-, and blue-sensitive layer.
* When developed, they leave behind a color dye.
  * The red-sensitive layer leaves behind cyan in the positive image
  * The green-sensitive layer leaves behind magenta
  * The blue-sensitive layer leaves behind yellow
* Essentially, Lomochrome Purple swaps the green and blue channels
