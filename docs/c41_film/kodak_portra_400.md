# Kodak Portra 400

If every color film died and only one remained, I hope it would be Portra 400. This is the most versatile film currently in production.

* [Technical Data Sheet](./resources/kodak_portra_400.pdf)
* Smallest grain of all ISO 400 films
* Medium saturaturation
* Tolerates some underexposure
* Tolerates insane overexposure

## Compared to Portra 160

* More saturation
* More grain
* More contrast
* More Latitude

## Compared to Ektar 100

* Less saturation
* More grain
* Less contrast
* Much wider latitude

## Techniques

* Overexposing Portra 400 creates more pastel colors
* It is super safe to overexpose, so it's better to err on overexposure

## Overexposure, Underexposure, and pushing

* Kyle McDougall: [Testing The Exposure Limits Of Kodak's Portra 400 Film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3OIzjhu9eo)
  * EI 200 (1 stop overexposure): barely discernable difference
  * EI 100 (2 stops over): slight differences in contrast and saturation
  * EI 25 (4 stops over): noticeable color shifts, and less contrast, barely usable
  * EI 50 (3 stops over): increased differences in contrast and saturation, but still usable
  * EI 800 (1 stop underexposure): muddy shadows but still usable
  * EI 1600 (2 stops under): Very muddy shadows. Not usable unless the look is intentional.
  * EI 3200 (3 stops under): Totally unusable
* attic Darkroom: [Pushing Portra 400 to 12800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMWNCRLw6wg)
  * Pushed to 800: color shift of red to orange. Greens and blues still okay. Little bit warmer than box speed
  * Pushed to 1600: barely usable images, noticeable red cast, but can be corrected
  * Pushed to 3200: muddy shadows make images unusable. Red has color shift to yellow
