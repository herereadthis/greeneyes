## Notes

* One bag of developer powder makes 5 liters
* Xtol does not contain hydroquinone. It uses ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and Phenidone as developing agents
* Xtol is a solvent developer. It produces fine grain with some loss of sharpness.
* Dilute Xtol 1:1 to gain sharpness and increased grain
* Xtol does not reduce film speed

## Inversions

* Kodak recommends 5-7 inversions to last 5 seconds. Repeat every 30 seconds

## Replenishment

* Keep a 1L bottle of stock solution for development, and a 4L bottle of stock solution as replenishment.
* For every roll of film, pour 70mL from the 4L bottle into the 1L bottle. 
* dispose enough of the developer you used to develop the film so that the 1L bottle is full again.
* Supposedly, you can continue to do this indefinitely.
