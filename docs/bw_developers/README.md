# Black and White Developers

Unlike the C-41 process for color negative films, there are limitless possibilities for black and white film development. 

* You can try different developers
* You can try developers at different dilutions
* Any temperature is fine. There's more contrast and more grain at higher temperatures. However, most guides use 20&deg;C

## Solvent Developers

* Solvent developers produce finer grain by allowing the silver to distribute and form smaller clumps.
* The tradeoff is solvent developers will appear less sharp.
