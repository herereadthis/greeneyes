# Black and White Developers

Unlike the C-41 process for color negative films, there are limitless possibilities for black and white film development. 

* You can try different developers
* You can try developers at different dilutions
* Any temperature is fine. There's more contrast and more grain at higher temperatures. However, most guides use 20&deg;C

## Solvent Developers

* Solvent developers produce finer grain by allowing the silver to distribute and form smaller clumps.
* The tradeoff is solvent developers will appear less sharp.

## Non-Solvent Developers

* Non-solvent developers will produce greater apparent sharpness (accuatance) at the expense of larger grain
* The most well known non-solvent developers are [Rodinal](./rodinal.md) and HC-110

## Agitation

* Ilford Method
  * 4 inversions to last a total of 10 seconds. (1.25s per flip)
  * Repeat every minute
* Kodak Method
  * 5-7 inversions to last 5 seconds (0.5s per flip)
  * Repeat every 30 seconds
