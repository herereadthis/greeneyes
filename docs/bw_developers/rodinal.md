# Rodinal

Rodinal is one of the oldest and still one of the best developers.

* High apparent sharpness, a.k.a. "accutance"
* Tradeoff is larger grain
* Rodinal will last for ever. It will oxidize and turn dark, but it won't expire.

## What is Accutance?

Accutance is apparent sharpness, which is different than actual sharpeness. The way Rodinal will work is it will exhaust nearby chemicals which increases contrast around edges. Practically speaking, it produces a halo affect whenever there's a line between light and dark. The halo effect can happen in stand development as the temperature of the developer changes over time




## Stand Development

* 2 minutes pre-soak with 20&deg;C water will expand the emulsion and prevent unevent development
* 5mL Rodinal into 500mL water.
* Continuous agitation for one minute, then let sit for a whole hour. Don't touch it!
* Some people worry about something called "Bromide Drag" which has to do with how the developer flows across sprocket holes

## Comparing Dilutions

* [Rodinal 1:25 vs. 1:100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJmjAqjtsew) (90 minutes stand development)
  * 1:100 has more shadow detail, grain difference is negligible
  * 1:25 appears sharper, but that might be due to having more contrast
  * Conclusion: the true benefit of stand development is speed increase with more shadow detail
* [Rodinal 1:25 vs. 1:50](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2703w7HI_5M)
  * 1:25 is ideal for normal contrast scenes
  * 1:50 is better for high contrast scenes as it tones down the highlights
