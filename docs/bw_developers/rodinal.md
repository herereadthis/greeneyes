# Rodinal

Rodinal is one of the oldest and still one of the best developers.

* High apparent sharpness, a.k.a. "accutance"
* Tradeoff is larger grain

## What is Accutance?

Accutance is apparent sharpness, which is different than actual sharpeness. The way Rodinal will work is it will exhaust nearby chemicals which increases contrast around edges. Practically speaking, it produces a halo affect whenever there's a line between light and dark.
