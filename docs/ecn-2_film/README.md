# ECN-2 (Motion Picture Color Negative) Film

ECN (Eastman Color Negative) Motion picture film is essentatially the same as color negative film, except that the film has an additional carbon "rem-jet" (removal by water jet) layer. The carbon serves 3 purposes: prevent light refaction, guard against static electricity as it runs at high speeds through film cameras, and prevent scratches. The ECN-2 process is itself a bit different than C-41. Essentially ECN-2 chemistry creates negatives that are flat and dull, but contain all available information. The expectation is the the film gets color graded for movies.

## Respooling

There are many companies which will take motion picture film, remove the rem-jet layer, and sell it as C-41 film. The most notable brand is Cinestill. Note that the rated ISO is higher: the reason is the C-41 process will produce denser negatives.

* Cinestill 50D is Kodak Vision3 50D
* Cinestill 400D is Kodak Vision3 250D
* Cinestill 800T is Kodak Vision3 500T
