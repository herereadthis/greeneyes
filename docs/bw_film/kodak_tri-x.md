# Kodak Tri-X

Kodak Tri-X is a true 400 ISO speed, cubic grain film. It has very wide latitude. It is sharp. It has a dynamic curve that is pleasing for skin tones, landscapes, anything. It is the greatest black and white film eveer made, and is the benchmark against which all other films are compared. 

Unfortunately is totally unaffordable now. There is nothing more to say about Tri-X, because the expense just leads to disappointment and dismay.

Do not shoot Kodak Tri-X.
