# Foma Fomapan 100

Fomapan 100 is a traditional grained, true 100-speed film.

* [Technical Data Sheet](./resources/foma_fomapan_100.pdf)
* Compared to Tri-X, the grain is slightly smaller than Tri-X, and large than T-Max 100.
* More constrast than Ilford FP4 ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mt0ob5wiuVg))
* Does not do well with push-processing, unless in truly dull conditions
* There is some halation around highlights
* Film curl does make scanning a bit difficult
