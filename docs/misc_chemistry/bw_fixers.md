# Black and White fixers

There are two main types of fixers for black and white negative film development:

1. Rapid Fixers
  * Made from ammonium thiosulfate
  * Generally works faster
  * Easier to wash

2. Hypo Fixers
  * Made from sodium thiosulfate
  * Generally works slower
  * More difficult to wash
  * Recommended that you use a hypo clearing agent to decrease wash times
    * made from sodium sulfite
    * Don't use with staining developers (e.g. Pyro) - it might wash off the stain
